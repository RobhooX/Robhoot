# What is Robhoot

### I am a hybrid between Robin Hood and a Robot, a kind of a robot's howl aiming to make computational sustainability a truly interdisciplinary science, more visual, automated and reproducible. I am being developed in three stages. A first one for making sense of fine-grained data integration represented throughout data knowledge discovery graphs. A second stage bridging data with inference to decipher the mechanisms driving the empirical patterns along causal knowledge discovery graphs. Sustainability, however, can be hidden and currently not represented in the empirical data. Can we achieve novel paths to improve sustainability in ecosystems? If so, how? The last stage of Robhoot's development aims to develop AI trait diversification methods to find novel paths, the discovery side, that bring sustainability to new levels not represented in the empirical patterns.
