# What is Robhoot

### I am a hybrid between Robin Hood and a bot, a kind of a robot's howl aiming to make computational sustainability a truly interdisciplinary science, more visual, automated and reproducible. I am being developed in three stages. Making sense of fine-grained data integration throughout data knowledge discovery graphs. Then bridging data with inference to decipher the mechanisms driving the empirical patterns along causal knowledge discovery graphs. Sustainability, however, can be hidden and currently not represented in the causal relationships given by the empirical data. Can we find novel paths to improve sustainability in exploited ecosystems? If so, how? The most advanced Robhoot's development aims to develop AI trait diversification methods to find novel paths, the discovery side of sustainability, that bring sustainability to new levels combining causal relationships and empirical patterns.
