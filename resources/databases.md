# A list of scientific databases

## Biology

### molecular biology

* [GigaDB Dasets](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100040) contains 550 discoverable, trackable, and citable datasets that have been assigned DOIs and are available for public download and use. Dataset types include genomics, imaging, proteomics, software, neuroscience, workflow, metadata and more.
* [Biomart](www.biomart.org/) is a community-driven project to provide unified access to distributed research data to facilitate the scientific discovery process.
* [DisGeNET](http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/home) is a discovery platform containing one of the largest publicly available collections of genes and variants associated to human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype–phenotype relationships. 
* [GeneBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)  is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences.
* [The Nucleotide database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/)  is a collection of sequences from several sources, including GenBank, RefSeq, TPA and PDB.


### Paleobiology

* <a name="paleobiodb"></a>[Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/) is a non-governmental, non-profit public resource for paleontological data. It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers. Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for organisms of all geological ages, as well data services to allow easy access to data for independent development of analytical tools, visualization software, and applications of all types. The Database’s broader goal is to encourage and enable data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions. Check [Fossilworks](#fossilworks) for accessing this database.

### Ecology

* [AlgaeBase](http://www.algaebase.org/) is a global algal database of taxonomic, nomenclatural and distributional information.
* [Avibase - The World Bird Database](https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/) is an extensive database information system about all birds of the world, containing over &1 million records about 10,000 species and 22,000 subspecies of birds, including distribution information for 12,000 regions, taxonomy, synonyms in several languages and more.
* [FishBase](www.fishbase.org/home.htm) is a global biodiversity information system on finfishes. Its initial goal to provide key facts on population dynamics for 200 major commercial species has now grown to having a wide range of information on all species currently known in the world: taxonomy, biology, trophic ecology, life history, and uses, as well as historical data reaching back to 250 years.
* [Tree of Life Web Project](http://tolweb.org/tree/) is a collection of information about biodiversity compiled collaboratively by hundreds of expert and amateur contributors. Its goal is to contain a page with pictures, text, and other information for every species and for each group of organisms, living or extinct. Connections between Tree of Life web pages follow phylogenetic branching patterns between groups of organisms, so visitors can browse the hierarchy of life and learn about phylogeny and evolution as well as the characteristics of individual groups.
* [Global Biotraits Database](http://biotraits.ucla.edu/) is an online resource for empirical data on how biological traits respond to environmental drivers such as temperature, light, and salinity. This database represents the largest and most comprehensive database for the thermal responses of physiological and ecological traits, especially consumer-resource interactions. Currently, we have a total of 2445 intraspecific trait response curves from a total of 1508 species.
* [Amniote life-history database](esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/269/) is to perform comparative analyses with birds, mammals, and reptiles. See also this [blog post](https://www.google.es/amp/s/jabberwocky.weecology.org/2015/11/23/trait-databases-what-is-the-end-goal/amp/)
* [Quantifying and scaling global plant trait diversity](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php) is a network of vegetation scientists headed by Future Earth and the Max Planck Institute for iogeochemistry, providing a global archive of curated plant traits.
* [AnAge: the Animal Ageing and Longevity Database](http://genomics.senescence.info/species/) is a curated database of ageing and life history in animals, including extensive longevity records. AnAge was primarily developed for comparative biology studies, in particular studies of longevity and ageing, but can also be useful for ecological and conservation studies and as a reference for zoos and field biologists.
* [BIRD: Banks' Integrated Reporting Dictionary](http://banks-integrated-reporting-dictionary.eu) aims to foster cooperation in the field of regulatory reporting thus alleviating the reporting burden for the banks and improving the quality of data reported to the authorities.
* [Interaction Web Database](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/interactionweb/) is a nonprofit, cooperative database containing published data on species interaction networks. Also check [IntWebData](#IntWebData)
* [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) is a free, online database of animal tracking data. Check [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4eCWkdyQY) for an animation made from Movebank's data.
* [NEMAPLEX](http://nemaplex.ucdavis.edu) is a virtual encyclopedia on soil and plant nematodes.

## Tools

* [TraitDB](https://github.com/NESCent/TraitDB) is a Ruby on Rails web application for storing and searching trait data. It is in development at NESCent to support working groups.
* [MLDB](https://mldb.ai/) is an open-source database designed for machine learning.
* [Germinate](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/germinate/) is a generic plant genetic resources database and offers facilities to store both standard collection information and passport data along with more advanced data types such as phenotypic, genotypic and field trial data. Germinate was originally implemented in MySQL and Perl but is moving with version 3 to MySQL and Google Web Toolkit (GWT). The [paper is here](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/139/2/619.full).
* <a name="IntWebData"></a> [IntWebData](https://github.com/sckott/IntWebData) is a package for interfacing with the [Interaction Web Database](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/interactionweb/), a website that hosts datasets on ecological networks. The package goals are to allow download of datasets, querying of taxonomic names in the datasets, and simple network plotting (using package bipartite).
* <a name="fossilworks"></a> [Fossilworks](http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl) provides query, download, and analysis tools that utilize the [Paleobiology Database](#paleobiodb)'s large relational database assembled by hundreds of paleontologists from around the world.
