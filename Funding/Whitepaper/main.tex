\lettrineabstract{\section{{\bf Summary}}

  Global sustainability is a major goal of humanity. Many studies have
  shown global sustainability could be achieved by strengthening
  transparency and feedbacks between social, ecological, technological
  and governance systems. Sustainability goals, however, strongly
  depend on global access to evidence- and research-based knowledge
  gaps. Yet, the science ecosystem lacks open-source technologies
  narrow down knowledge gaps. We introduce an open discovery network
  targeting knowledge gaps throughout open-access generation of fully
  reproducible science reports. Open discovery network encompasses a
  hybrid-automated-technology to lay out the foundation of an
  open-science ecosytem strengthening the robustness,
  decentralization, reproducibility and social accessibility of
  science. The project summarized here is not set out to deliver a
  finished open discovery network, but to provide the architecture of
  a science-enabled technology as a proof-of-principle to connect
  decentralized and neutral-knowledge generation with
  knowledge-inspired societies.}

\section{The Science Ecosystem}
Science and technology contain multiple steps of information transfer
among trusted and untrusted peers. As a consequence, science generates
knowledge with specific features. Which are the desirable features of
human-generated knowledge? Should such features be aligned with taking
informed decisions in complex social, governance, environmental and
technological problems? Can global transparency in knowledge
generation be achieved to facilitate sustainability goals of humanity?
Currently public funded science is highly centralized
\citep{Inhaber1977,Gunther2018}⁠⁠, prone to errors \citep{Fang2011},
difficult to reproduce \citep{Hardwicke2018}, and contains many biases
\citep{Ioannidis2005}. This makes science an ecosystem building up
problems to decrease the evidence- and research-based knowledge gaps
in humanity \citep{Mastrangelo2019}. Here we propose an open research
network fully accounting for the research cycle. The goal of such a
technology is to reduce global knowledge gaps while accounting for
centralization, bias, error-prone, non-reproducibility and lack of
incentives in the existing science and technology ecosystem (Figure 1
and Table 1).

    $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} targets global knowledge gaps (red path) and
  open-access fully reproducible discovery reports (green

  technology decentralizing reproducible knowledge
  graphs. $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} targets 1) {\bf qETLs} connecting
question-based knowledge gaps with data extraction, transformation and
loading algorithms for database integration and complexity reduction,
2) {\bf Bayesian Space Models} accounting for open-ended model
optimization techniques, 3) {\bf Animation Space} visualizing fitting
procedures and pattern generation connecting empirical data and
open-ended models, and 4) open and globally accessible {\bf Reporting}
formalized in natural processing language.}

The core feature of an open research network is to embed
knowledge-generation into reproducible automation and
decentralization. Currently, many studies focusing on decentralized
ecosystems are producing an immense gain of knowledge in a variety of
sectors about scalability, security and decentralization trade-offs
\citep{Golem2016,Durov2017,Androulaki2018,OceanProtocolFoundation2018,BigchainDBGmbH2018}. In
the open science ecosystem, only a few implementations of
decentralized technologies exist \citep{Gunther2018}. Automation and
AI technologies represent the other angle from which many advances are
rapidly occurring in digital ecosystems
\citep{Schmidhuber:2015,Reichstein,Gil2019}. While the existing
technological paradigm in many sectors is rapidly shifting towards
science-based decentralization and automation technologies, the
science ecosystem currently lack decentralized, neutral and
open-source knowledge-inspired technologies strongly impacting
knowledge-inspired societies (Figure 1 and Tables 1 to 3). Rapid
advances of research platforms automating parts of the research cycle
are currently under development Automating
\citep{Steinruecken,Guimera}.\footnote{This is by no means an
  exhaustive list but it gives an indication of the many projects
  currently in place:
  \href{https://www.nterminal.com}{NakamotoT},\href{https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/}{BigQuery},\href{https://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/}{Automated
    statistician},\href{http://www.modulos.ai/}{Modulos},\href{https://ai.google/}{Google

Most of the existing research projects aiming to automate part of the
research cycle are being built around close-source
software. Therefore, open-source, reproducible, decentralized and
automated technologies accounting for the research cycle are at a very
incipient stage of development. To move forward open-source
technologies accounting for the research cycle we need to compactly
integrate knowledge-generation (Figure 2a) to automated tools
connecting knowledge graphs (Figure 2b) and deep learning networks
(Figure 2c) in fully decentralized ecosystems (Figure 2d).

  \section{Design Goals}
  The open research network will be developed in four stages. The most
  advanced version is to provide real-time open-access reporting in a
  decentralized network. Figures 1 to 4 show goals and architecture,
  milestones, the digital ecosystem and the timeline for each of the
  stages, respectively.

      research paths as shown in {\bf a} using reproducible knowledge

  \section{Robhoot in Digital Ecosystems}
  The science ecosystem currently lack technologies fully automating
  the research cycle into the open-source digital ecosystem. Despite
  public institutions are demanding more reproducibility and openness
  of the data and the scientific process, and overall a shifting
  towards open and reproducible scientific and engineering landscapes,
  there are not currently open and integrated technologies aiming to
  compactly facilitate and distribute the scientific and engineering
  knowledge in open, reproducible and immutable knowledge networks
  (Tables 1 and 2).
  
  Automating knowledge-generation requires the integration of many
  distinct features. Usually, knowledge-generation comes from
  interactions within- and between-layers of the scientific process
  (Figure 2a). The feedbacks occurring within and among layers in the
  science and technology ecosystem also provide unexpected behaviors
  that are difficult to anticipate. Therefore many feedbacks and
  interactions within- and between-layers are not easy to reproduce if
  not properly accounted for. We will take advantage of the
  open-source software community to explore knowledge graphs,
  optimization, automation, and decentralization algorithms together
  to study the robustness and reproducibility properties of the
  scientific process (Figures 1 and 2).

  {\bf $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} aims to be a hybrid-technology accounting
  for many features (Tables 1 to 3). Producing such a multi-feature
  technology requires multidisciplinarity teams making contributions
  for each of the Robhoot features while integrating all these
  features in a rapidly evolving digital ecosystem. In this regard,
  the project aims to put together data and computer scientists (i.e.,
  distributed computing, open-source software development), scientists
  from the physics of complex systems (i.e., multilayer networks),
  artificial intelligence (i.e., deep learning and automation) and the
  biology, ecology and evolution of social, natural and technological
  ecosystems.

  One way of visualizing the dimensionality of $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$ in
  the digital ecosystem is to connect each layer of the scientific
  process (Figure 2a) to open-source software to gain functionality of
  the open research network (Figure 3). For example, Node 0 (left
  column, Figure 3) can be the Data Integration layer in Figure
  2a. This node is connected to seven nodes representing open-source
  ETLs open-source software (i.e., central column, Figure
  3). Connections between Node 0 and nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13
  can be rapidly evolving (i.e., indicated by the different red tones
  of the connections). Indeed, open-source ETLs are rapidly evolving
  towards accounting for many heterogeneous aspects of data
  integration (i.e., formats, historical-real time, storage,
  dimensions, size, bias and spatiotemporal resolution). ETLs can also
  be connected to a gradient of reporting generation (i.e., right
  column, Figure 3) noting reports containing only a subset of the
  interactions of the digital ecosystem network. The network of the
  fully automated research cycle can be one where Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3,
  and 4 represent the different layers of the research cycle (left
  column, Figure 3 and Figure 2a) connected to the open-source
  software of the digital ecosystem (central column, Figure 3) to
  generate full populations of reports (right column, Figure 3).

  %\caption{
  {\small {\bf Figure 3: Robhoot in Digital Ecosystems}: {\bf Left
      column}: {\bf $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$ v.1.0} representing the
    research cycle as nodes from number 0 to 4: Data integration (0),
    Complexity Reduction (1), Inference (2), Validation (3), and
    Visualization(4)). {\bf Central column}: Nodes representing the
    research cycle in the left column are connected to open-source
    software in the digital ecosystem. Connections with node number 0
    in the left column can, for example, represent the ETLs
    open-source software interactions required to generate the {\bf
      Universal ETLs} module. The same meaning applies to the
    different nodes of the left column. {\bf Right column}: Each node
    represents a report meaning there is a reporting gradient
    generated by the connections to the open-source software from
    where each report is generated only using a subset of the research
    layers and open-source software.}

      WP5} to {\bf WP8} will deploy knowledge graphs (KGs) into a

    deep learning networks to sample KGs populations to gain
    understanding of the robustness of the patterns in the data under
    distinct research paths (Figure 2c). {\bf $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$
      v.4.0} {\bf WP13} to {\bf WP16} will deploy KGs populations into
    a decentralized network of mutually trusting/untrusting peers with
    every peer maintaining the population of the KGs.}

\section{Conclusion}
Science and technology ecosystems are in need of accounting for the
uncertainties, reproducibility and immutability related to the
complexity of the research process (Table 1). Such needs are not just
for a specific stage of the research cycle, but from data acquisition
and integration to automated reporting generation because
knowledge-inspired societies and decentralized governance will demand
full research cycle transparency to solve complex social,
environmental and technological problems (Tables 2 and 3). Reducing
knowledge-gaps at global scales in knowledge-inspired societies bring
many challenges to our research proposal because obtaining robust
knowledge from integrating many layers of the research cycle, each
containing its own set of methods and uncertainties, can generate
divergent, fragile and contradictory outcomes.

We will develop a flexible and adaptive research method focusing step
by step in increasing levels of complexity (i.e., from {\bf
  $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} v.1.0 to v.4.0, Figure 4). Our motivation will
be to provide a first open-access proof of concept of how the
technology works: we will automate reproducible research paths ({\bf
  $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} v.1.0) to sample the KGs ({\bf
  $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} v.2.0) contrasting deep learning algorithms to
estimate the uncertainty of the ruled-based inference obtained by
fitting predictions to simulated data ({\bf $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$}
v.3.0). Accounting for the uncertainties of each of the research
stages when sampling the KGs comes from the many distinct paths within
and across the layers in the research cycle (Figure 2a). {\bf
  $\mathcal{ROBHOOT}$} v.4.0 will test a variety of consensus
algorithms to explore the degree of security, decentralization and
scalability of the ledger knowledge network using the generated
population of KGs.

Despite our focus will be bias towards the algorithmic robustness
during the four stages of development, we will implement a
domain-specific case study, a ``Biodiversity, Global Change and
Sustainability Research'', to test the robustness of the rule-based
inference obtained by fitting the KGs to empirical patterns. The high
risk associated to robustly automate the full research cycle for
producing immutable open knowledge will be buffered to a great extend
because the existing digital ecosystem of highly reliable open-source
software tools (Figure 3).
