\section{{\bf Title: Deep process-based learning networks in biological, technological and economical systems}}
%Alternative title: Deep process-based learning networks platform 

\section{{\bf Summary}}
%2,000 characters: most relevant aspects; goals; duration in months}
We are in a enthralling scientific era. We have the computer power,
the open-source tools, the know-how in many specialized fields and the
team capabilities to infer complex patterns from highly heterogeneous
data. We are in a period where novel analytical methods and data are
being fussioned at an incredible speed. Yet, deciphering the strength
of process-based feedbacks underlying patterns of big multilayer data
across fields is at a very incipient stage (Figure 1). Our proposal
aims to fussion data with process-based feedbacks to disentangle the
mechanisms underlying complex empirical patterns. First, we will
develop an open-source automated research platform accounting for data
integration, complexity reduction, inference, validation,
visualization and reporting generation (Figure 2). Second, we will
test the platform to decipher the strength of the feedbacks underlying
Earth Biodiversity patterns accounting for multilayer network data
(Figure 3). Our research goals contain two main milestones for a 24
months duration plan (Figure 4): The first milestone will be the
deployment of an automated research platform by the end of the first
year. The second will test the automated research prototype with Earth
biodiversity data as a case study to be developed during the second
year to show mechanistic feedbacks inference in complex empirical
patterns.

\section{Background and objectives}

% degree of innovation technical, economic and social importance
Specialization has produced an immense gain in detailed knowledge at
each of the levels and scales studied across many scientific
disciplines. However, integrating the information obtained in
specialized fields with existing technologies and methods in natural,
technological, social and economical systems still present many
challenges. Despite rapid advances of automated research platforms
facilitating data integration accounting for parts of the research
cycle\footnote{This is by no means an exhaustive list but it gives an
  indication of the many projects taking currently place:
  \href{https://www.nterminal.com}{NakamotoT},\href{https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/}{BigQuery},\href{https://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/}{Automated
    statistician},\href{http://www.modulos.ai/}{Modulos},\href{https://ai.google/}{Google
    AI},\href{https://iris.ai}{Iris}\href{https://github.com/DS3Lab/easeml}{easeml}}
open-source automated research platforms are still at a very incipient
stage of development.

One of the reasons automated research platforms are still at a very
incipient stage of development is because most methods in data science
and other scientific disciplines have been considered classically as
distinct fields. This is rapidly changing due to the current
scientific ecosystem. We are at an stage where merging methods from
distinct fields is radically transforming the discipline boundaries,
the reproducibility of science and our predicting-understanding
power\citep{Reichsteietal2019}. Many recent approaches applying deep
learning methods in biology, economics, social and technological
systems have mostly focused on pattern detection within one level of
organization \citep{Sheehan&Song:2016} (OTHER REFS SYSTEMS). While
this might produce additional gain in detailed knowledge at each level
for understanding such systems, it remains unknown how many layers are
going to be needed for maximizing predictive- and process-based
knowledge in biological, economical social and technological systems
(Figure 1).

Gaining predictive and understanding power need the merging of
distinct databases into hybrid deep process-based learning methods
accounting for many layers and the topology of the interactions within
and between the
layers\citep{Schmidhuber:2015,Ghahramani:2015,Melianetal:2018,Reichsteietal2019}
(OTHER REFS HERE). Many methods from data science and biological,
economical and technological systems share fundamental properties
(i.e., network-like patterns, multiple layers, spatiotemporal
dynamics, interdependent hieraqrchies and feedbacks with interacting
learning entities within and between the layers, etc), and the full
potential of these shared properties have not been sufficiently
explored combining big data with deep process-based multilayer
networks in automated research platforms (Figure 2). In this regard,
science, engineering and technological landscapes require the
integration of many layers to facilitate automation, reproducibility,
cooperation, new science of science methodologies, and public access
to the full research cycle and research findings. Yet, technologies
facilitating compactly open-access to the full research cycle
accounting for multilayer data is currently not in place. Our research
proposal aims to deploy a multilayer automated network accounting
fully for the research cycle to provide decentralized and real-time
open-access data-rule-knowledge to gain informed decisions to help
solve complex ecological, social and technological problems.

Data driven multilayer process-based methods can increase the pool of
deep learning models in data science to understand more broadly the
connection between predictive power (i.e., pattern detection), and
understanding power (i.e., process-based inference). While conceptual
frameworks unifying different layers in many research fields is well
established (REFS HERE :: 28–31), there is currently a lack of deep
process-based learning models accounting for many layers in
biological, social, technological and economical systems. Here is
where data science can benefit to further developing approaches
unifying data driven patterns and process based theory (REFES HERE ::
35,36). The interaction between prediction and understanding power
can also advance synthesis in data-science by gaining broader
insights from deep pattern- and process- based learning models that
can be applied to other many fields.

\section{Research methodology}

INTRODUCE BRIEFLY THE TWO PARTS: 
     \begin{itemize}
     \item To develop an automated data-driven platform combined with
       process-based AI.
     \item To infer how the interdependencies of the different
       biological levels of organization impact Earth biodiversity.
     \end{itemize}

     \subsection{Goal 1: Automated data-driven platform}
     
SUMMARIZE MORE COMPACTLY THIS PARAGRAPH     
     \cite{Webb2018,Heaven2019} The recent success of Artifical
     Intelligence can be easily illustrated with applications to many
     discipline. Examples could include machine learning nowcasts
     lightening occurrence \cite{Mostajabi2019}, ...  astounding
     performance in beating board and video games
     \cite{Mnih2015,Silver2016}, computer vision that enables
     self-driving cars \cite{Poggio2004,Krizhevsky2012}, medical
     diagnosing \cite{Ferrucci2013}, ...

     {\bf economic and social importance} Significance of the project
     for data science The project will help to improve multilayer
     inference from broad classes of multidimensional data. It will
     bring a class of deep learning networks, deep process-based
     learning networks, to facilitate merging biodiversity research
     and data science. Deep process-based learning networks will serve
     as a fundamental and applied tool to unfold the interdependence
     among biological levels for understanding biodiversity dynamics
     and its current decline with and without feedback. The project
     will also be communicating in a permanent public exhibition how
     data science and biodiversity research account for interacting
     biological levels for predicting future response scenarios to
     rapid global change.

     \caption{{\bf Figure 2: Automated research platform prototype:}
       {\bf a)} Our prototype contains initially six layers (this is
       not an exhaustive number): Data Integration, Complexity
       reduction, Pattern-process inference, Validation, Visualization
       and Reporting. Nodes and links represent algorithms and
       interactions between two algorithms, respectively. The
       inter-layer interactions will be implemented using the
       open-Renku-Swiss Data Science Center
       platform\footnote{\href{https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{Renku}}. The
       intra-layer interactions will be developed initially in julia
       language (other languages will come into play during the
       development of each layer). {\bf b)} A julia-computing-language
       prototype of an automated research platform. Nodes and links in
       each layer represent julia packages and interactions between
       two packages, respectively. The figure shows the julia packages
       to be used for the Data integration layer containing the
       packages "Retriever.jl" ({\bf Re}), "Query.jl" ({\bf Qu}),
       "MySQL.jl" ({\bf My}), "SQlite.jl" ({\bf lite}), and
       "DataFrames.jl" ({\bf df}). This cartoon representing many
       intra- and inter-layer connections might be helpful to show the
       vision of the platform. For example, the path taken to solve a
       specific intra- or inter-domain (fundamental or applied)
       question can be quantified by many metrics each producing a
       distribution of automated solutions across many nodes in a
       distributed and open network, the Robhoot Open Network
       (RON). This distribution can be analyzed to quantify properties
       as robustness, reproducibility and bias of a fundamental or
       applied solution.  }

     \subsection{Goal 2: Deep-process based learning networks in Earth Biodiversity}

 We will apply our results to decipher the complexity of the
     processes and the feedbacks underlying patterns in Earth
     biodiversity data. We are in a massive human-driven biodiversity
     extinction with large uncertain consequences for Earth climate,
     life conditions and the stability of Earth (Figure
     3). Uncertainty comes mostly from the unknown consequences of
     feedbacks.  contrasting deep process-based scenarios accounting
     for feedbacks between the Earth system and Biodiversity are at a
     very incipient stage (Figure 2). For this to happen we need to
     connect fundamental and applied science (Figure 3b) and one way
     to do it is throughout distributed open research platforms to
     provide informaton for management forums in applied conservation
     and sustainability centers. This proposal aims to develop a
     distributed open-source automated research platform to integrate
     multiple databases into Biodiversity dynamics and function
     scenarios taking into account the interdependencies among
     biological levels and scales in ecological and evolutionary
     networks (Box 1 and Figures 3 and 4).


\begin{mybox}\begin{singlespace}
{\bf{Box 1. Deep process-based learning networks in Biodiversity research}}\\
\begin{small}
  We will infer process-based species distribution maps accounting for
  biological levels using learning networks. Most datasets in
  biodiversity are collections of small data. In areas such as species
  ranges and species interactions, there is a large amount of data,
  but only a relatively small amount of data match the species ranges
  or the species interactions with lower biological level data as the
  gene architecture or the phenotypes. To account for such uncertainty
  we will use a formalism considering the heterogeneity at individual
  level\citep{Ghahramani:2015} coupling the gene-to-phenotype map to populations, and
  interactions among phenotypes to communities and species ranges, so
  that information can be borrowed from other similar levels across
  the landscape. We will develop our formalism into hierarchical
  Bayesian neural networks to generate biodiversity
  distribution maps accounting for biotic, abiotic and migration
  traits that can be compared against the empirical distribution
  patterns. We will consider many populations characterized each by
  individuals containing $\mathrm{T}$ normally distributed traits
  (i.e., biotic, abiotic, and migration traits represented as {\bf
    $z_{i}$} with $i$ the biotic, abiotic or the migration
  trait). Populations will be located in a network of
  discrete/continuous sites guided by long/lat empirical data
  connected by migration events and the local population demography
  will be driven by the temporal dependent fitness function accounting
  for trait architecture following
\begin{equation}
  \hspace{-0.05 in} \mathrm{W({\bf z_{i}})}^{t}_{jx} = exp[\left -\gamma(((\mathrm{\bf z_{i}}^{t}_{jx} - \mathrm{\bf \theta}_{jx})^2)^T \mathrm{\bf \omega}^{-1} (\mathrm{\bf z_{i}}^{t}_{jx} - {\bf \mathrm{\bf \theta}_{jx})^2)\right],\hspace{-0.15 in}
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{\bf (z_{i})}^{t}_{jx}$ is the vector of trait values of
phenotype $z$ at time $t$ for species $j$ and site $x$,
${\bf \theta}_{jx}$ is the multivariate fitness optimum of species $j$
in site $x$, ${\bf \omega}$ is the covariance matrix\citep{Lande:1980,
  Melo&Marroig:2014}, and $\gamma$ determines the interaction
sensitivity to deviations from the biotic, abiotic and migration
optimum. If the covariance matrix, ${\bf \omega}$, is diagonal, then
we are in a no correlated stabilizing selection scenario. Each trait
is independently evolving and the connections within and between each
biological level are modular and mostly weak. Adding covariation among
traits will result in correlated stabilizing selection with strong
interactions within and between each biological level. The population
dynamics of species $j$ in site $x$ is then given by
{\begin{equation}{\frac {dN_{jx}}{dt}}&= r_{jx}(F(W({\bf z})) + m_{jx}(F(W({\bf z})),\end{equation}}
where $r_{jx}$ and $m_{jx}$ are the multivariate fitness-dependent
intrinsic growth and migration rate, respectively. The first scenario
accounting for independently evolving traits will be our proxy for
quasi-independent levels considering modularity within- and
between-layers (i.e., a highly modular pleiotropy matrix determining
the genotype-phenotype map and a highly modular within- and
between-species interactions with most interactions weak or zero
across the landscape). Such scenario will produce a non- or
weakly-interactive species biodiversity map. The second scenario will
account for correlated traits and we will consider this scenario as
our proxy for feedbacks within and among layers. We will explore a
range of topologies from bidirectional recurrent neural networks
(BRNN) to feedforward neural networks (FNN) and reinforcement learning
(RL) in both static and unknown and dynamic optimum\citep{Schmidhuber:2015}. This scenario will
produce an strongly-interactive species biodiversity map. We will
disturb both scenarios following random and non-random disturbance
regimes (i.e., removing specific interactions, abundances and
habitats) and will quantify responses to disturbances using a variety
of metrics, from local, regional and global biodiversity
metrics\citep{Melianetal:2018}.
\end{small}
\end{singlespace}
\end{mybox}

     
     The one-level and one-scale approach might be insufficent to
     understand the consequences of biodiversity decline in predicting
     the outcome of feedbacks between Earth system and the diversity
     of life. To gain predictive and understanding power in
     biodiversity research we are going to need to merge distinct
     databses into hybrid deep process-based learning methods
     accounting for many layers and the topology of the interactions
     within and between the layers\citep{Melianetal:2018}. Many
     methods from data science and biological systems share
     fundamental properties (i.e., network-like patterns, multiple
     layers, etc). Yet the full potential of these shared properties
     have not been sufficiently explored. Biological systems are
     composed by many layers, and they can contain interdependent
     hierarchies and feedbacks with interacting learning entities
     within and between the layers (Figure 2). We will integrate
     different biological layers into a platform to explore
     contrasting scenarios of Biodiversity dynamics accounting for
     interdependencies and feedbacks within and between layers (Box 1
     and Figures 3 and 4).

\section{{\bf Benefits for Eawag and the Biodiversity research community}}
My sabbatical period attempts to fill two main gaps in Biodiversity
research:
1) developing a platform integrating multiple datasets into process-
and ruled-based approaches framing it in multilayer and deep learning
networks. The sabbatical will allow me to strengthen international
collaborations by submitting a FET-OPEN-EU research grant
proposal. The platform, will be fully developed in open source
software and coupled to the Renku platform (Swiss data Science Center)
and Eawag IT domain. The interactions among different platforms (i.e.,
Renku, Robhoot and others) will be a collective, multi-institutional
networking effort to integrate transdisciplinary, fundamental and
applied Biodiversity research. This will help Eawag to strengthen its
cooperatiop with international open research platforms by providing
expertise and data from Aquatic ecosystems.
\\
2) connecting fundamental and applied research combining open research
platforms can provide meaningful for enriching management forums in
applied conservation and sustainability centers. Centers that can
benefit from such tools in Switzerland and abroad will be the Wyss
Centre for Biodiversity, Climate Change and Land use with four planned
institutes worldwide, the NCCR centre in Bern and the LifeWatch EU
initiative in different parts of Europe. The CEEB could contribute to
an emerging network of Swiss synthesis centres with emphasis on
distributed and open-data-source driven biodiversity research centers
joining fundamental and applied research.
%\subsection{{\bf International host center for the sabbatical}}
%I've been discussing options for my sabbatical with complex systems
%institutes in Europe, the Amsterdam, IAS, and the Mallorca, IFISC, and
%in the USA, the New England, NECSI, and the Santa Fe Institute,
%SFI. They all have excellent teams for implementing computing
%platforms, computing facilities to run locally prototypes without much
%server regulations, together with Linux driven IT teams and team of
%researchers I would like to work with. After contrasting the pros and
%cons of each of these centers, I have chosen the one in Mallorca.
%The IFISC in Mallorca has a easy accessible full team of IT researchers
