\lettrineabstract{\section{{\bf Summary}} Robhoot aims to fully
  automate the research cycle in a open decentralized
  network. Research automation with reporting generation might help to
  contrast informed decisions when solving complex social,
  environmental and technological problems. Current technologies for
  scientific inquiry and decision-making are highly fragmented and
  thus only increase robustness, reproducibility, open-access and the
  interactions with the public marginally. The goal of Robhoot is to
  propose a hybrid-neutral-technology to lay out the foundation for an
  open-science research ecosystem aiming to strengthen the robustness
  and reproducibility of science. Robhoot is not set out to deliver a
  finished research open network in the science ecosystem, but to
  provide a science-enabled technology in establishing a prototype
  proof-of-principle to connect automated, decentralized and
  neutral-knowledge generation with knowledge-inspired societies.}

\section{The Science Ecosystem}
The process of science and technology requires multiple steps of
information transfer among trusted/untrusted peers. Science and
technology produce knowledge and features like reproducibility,
decentralization, and immutability of knowledge are key to reach
neutral open-access reports when taking informed decisions in complex
social, environmental and technological problems. However, currently
public funded science is highly centralized
\citep{Inhaber1977,Gunther2018}⁠⁠, prone to errors \citep{Fang2011},
difficult to reproduce \citep{Hardwicke2018}, and contains many biases
\citep{Ioannidis2005}. In this regard, automated-based knowledge
following a secure peer-to-peer architecture storing the open-source
knowledge graphs derived from the paths of the research cycle is far
from reality. Taken together, these elements make the connection
between the scientific process, open-access and reproducible research
reporting for decision-making highly improbable. Despite many projects
are aiming at making the science ecosystem less centralized and biased
while increasing openness and reproducibility a science-enabled
technological paradigm connecting open-science to knowledge-inspired
societies is not currently in place \citep{Gunther2018}.

Many studies in decentralized ecosystems are producing an immense gain
in detailed knowledge about scalability, security and decentralization
trade-offs
\citep{Golem2016,Durov2017,Androulaki2018,OceanProtocolFoundation2018,BigchainDBGmbH2018}. Automation
and AI technologies is the other angle from which many advances are
rapidly occurring \citep{Schmidhuber:2015,Reichstein,Gil2019}. Yet,
while the existing technological paradigm is rapidly shifting towards
science-based decentralization and automation technologies, end-to-end
open-source research accounting for decentralized, neutral and
automated knowledge-inspired technologies are missing (Table 1). Rapid
advances of automated research platforms facilitating data integration
accounting for part of the research cycle are currently under
development\footnote{This is by no means an exhaustive list but it
  gives an indication of the many projects currently in place:
  \href{https://www.nterminal.com}{NakamotoT},\href{https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/}{BigQuery},\href{https://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/}{Automated
    statistician},\href{http://www.modulos.ai/}{Modulos},\href{https://ai.google/}{Google
    AI},\href{https://iris.ai}{Iris},\href{https://github.com/DS3Lab/easeml}{easeml}}
but open-source decentralized and automated networks accounting fully
for the research cycle are still at a very incipient stage of
development. While conceptual frameworks conceptualizing the required
layers in many research fields are well established (Figure 1a), there
is currently a lack of integration, development and automated tools
connecting knowledge graphs (Figure 1b) to deep process-based learning
networks to explore their robustness (Figure 1c) in fully
decentralized ecosystems (Figure 1d).

  \section{Robhoot Design Goals}
  Robhoot will be developed in four different stages following
  standard version protocols. The most advanced version is to provide
  real-time open-access reporting by a decentralized neutral-knowledge
  network to gain informed decisions when solving complex social,
  environmental and technological problems. Automating the research
  cycle in a open research network ultimately aims to contrast
  human-produced science with machine-produced science to enrich the
  human-knowledge graphs in a neutral-knowledge-inspired
  society. Figures 1 to 3 show Robhoot stages, Robhoot in a digital
  ecosystem and the timeline for each of the stages, respectively.

  \section{Robhoot in Digital Ecosystems}
  The science ecosystem currently lack technologies fully automating
  the research cycle into digital ecosystems. Despite public
  institutions are demanding more reproducibility and openness of the
  data and the scientific process, and overall a shifting towards open
  and reproducible scientific and engineering landscapes, there are
  not currently open and integrated technologies aiming to compactly
  facilitate and distribute the scientific and engineering knowledge
  in open, reproducible and immutable knowledge networks.
  
  Automating knowledge-generation requires the integration of many
  distinct traits or features. Usually, knowledge-generation comes
  from interactions within- and between-layers of the scientific
  process (Figure 1a). The feedbacks occurring among layers in the
  science and technology ecosystem also provide unexpected behaviors
  that are difficult to anticipate. Therefore many feedbacks and
  interactions within- and between-layers are not easy to reproduce if
  not properly accounted for. Robhoot will take advantage of the
  open-source software community to explore how knowledge graphs,
  optimization, automation, and decentralization algorithms can be
  connected to the robustness and reproducibility of the scientific
  process.

  Therefore, Robhoot aims to be a hybrid-technology accounting for
  many traits (Table 1: decentralized, open-access, immutable, robust,
  reproducible, and secure with trusted/untrusted peer-to-peer
  interactions). Producing such a multitrait technology means
  multidisciplinarity teams compactly making functional interactions
  within a rapidly evolving digital ecosystem. In this regard, Robhoot
  aims to put together scientists and engineers from data science,
  computer science (i.e., distributed computing, software
  development), the physics of complex systems (i.e., multilayer
  networks), artificial intelligence (i.e., deep learning and
  automation) and the biology, ecology and evolution of social,
  natural and technological ecosystems.

  One way of visualizing the multitrait dimensionality of Robhoot in
  the digital ecosystem is to connect each layer of the scientific
  process (Figure 1a) to the open-source software required to gain
  functionality of the automated research cycle (Figure 2). For
  example, Node 0 (left column, Figure 2) can be the Data Integration
  layer (Figure 1a). This node is connected to seven nodes that might
  represent open-source ETLs (i.e., extract, transform, load data
  open-source software, central column, Figure 2). Connections between
  Node 0 and nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 might be rapidly evolving
  (i.e., indicated by the different red tones of the
  connections). Indeed, open-source ETLs are rapidly evolving towards
  accounting for many heterogeneous aspects of data integration (i.e.,
  formats, historical-real time, storage, dimensions, size, bias and
  spatiotemporal resolution). ETLs might also be connected to a
  gradient of reporting generation (i.e., right column, Figure 2)
  noting reports containing only a subset of the interactions of the
  digital ecosystem network. The network of the fully automated
  research cycle can be one where Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent
  the different layers of the research cycle (left column, Figure 2
  and Figure 1a) connected to the open-source software of the digital
  ecosystem (central column, Figure 2) to produce the full population
  of reports (right column, Figure 2).

\section{Conclusion}
Science and technology ecosystems are in need of accounting for the
uncertainties, reproducibility and immutability related to the
complexity of the research process. This need is not just for a
specific stage of the research cycle, but from data acquisition and
integration to automated reporting generation because
knowledge-inspired societies and decentralized governance will demand
full research cycle transparency to solve complex social,
environmental and technological problems. This need brings many
challenges to our research proposal because obtaining robust knowledge
from integrating many layers of the research cycle, each containing
its own set of methods and uncertainties, can generate divergent,
fragile and contradictory outcomes.

We will develop a flexible research method focusing step by step in
different stages with varying levels of complexity (i.e., from Robhoot
1.0 to 4.0, Figure 3). Our motivation will be to provide a first
open-access proof of concept of how the technology works: we will
automate reproducible research paths along a multilayer network
(Robhoot 1.0) to sample the KGs (Robhoot 2.0) using different deep
learning algorithms to estimate the uncertainty of the ruled-based
inference obtained by fitting predictions to simulated data (Robhoot
3.0). Accounting for the uncertainties of each of the research stages
when sampling the KGs comes from the many distinct paths within and
across the layers in the research cycle (Figure 1a). Robhoot will test
a variety of consensus algorithms to explore the degree of security,
decentralization and scalability of the ledger knowledge network using
the generated population of KGs (Robhoot 4.0).

Despite our focus will be bias towards the algorithmic robustness
during the four stages of Robhoot development, we will develop a
domain-specific case study, a Robhoot Open Network, to test the
robustness of the rule-based inference obtained by fitting each of the
generated KG to empirical patterns. The high risk associated to
robustly automate the full research cycle for producing immutable open
knowledge will be buffered to a great extend because the existing
digital ecosystem of highly reliable open-source software tools
(Figure 2).
