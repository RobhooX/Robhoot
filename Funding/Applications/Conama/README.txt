How important are raw-data protocols for managing socio-technological ecosytems?

Protocols data Ecosystem A :: Example DATRAS ocean database :: Patterns -- Inference -- Discovery :: Empirical data ::
What data are needed for Ecosystem B as a function of data used in Ecosystem A? :: Simulated data

How important are raw-data protocols for managing socio-technological ecosytems?
Keywords: Circular economy -- Linear economy -- Reproducibility - Energy, mobility, water and waste - 

Given the current limits to access "full data life cycle" of main sustainability sectors - energy, mobility, water and waste - we need (computation driven) technologies to identify, access, facilitate, and analyze integrated (local, regional and global) data to target EU sustainability goals - Not only min-max multiobjective problems but discovery paths in the direction of computational sustainability - EU green deal. 
How role models sectors can help to transfer data protocols to other sustainability sectors (transfer from empirically driven model to simulated data model)? (Example DATRAS oceans at the EU level). 
Which are the (sustainability) sectors acting as role models for unified data protocols?

Green deal - mostly energy - from centralized to decentralized grid networks targeting many many small generation, accumulation and distribution nodes:
Which technology should be used to track the shift from centralized to decentralized grid networks? 
Can be this transfered to mobility, water and waste? How? 

Should we focus on one sector or the interactions (transversal) among sectors?
