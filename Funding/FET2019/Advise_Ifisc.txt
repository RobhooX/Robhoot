Dear all,

Here are some quick reminders for those who will be submitting project proposals for the September cut-off:

DO NOT FORGET

– Respect the page limitations in your proposal – RIA/IA 70 pages – CSA 50 pages.

– Make sure you address and submit under the correct topic

– Read carefully the work programme/call texts including introduction text and address all the requirements

– Read carefully the proposal template and its instructions and guidance – and implement them properly, be aware of the evaluation criteria

– Check SME status, SME budget is potentially a ranking criterion (in case of ties)

– Re-submission: high risk of failure if not truly addressing the new call

– Get somebody who was not involved to read your proposal "it was so obvious to the proposers what they were planning that they forgot to mention it“

– Check the PDF conversion of your proposal

– Do not wait until the last minute (= last day) to submit


Addressing (… and assessing) IPR Issues:

- Do not postpone IPR issues to the consortium agreement but outline in the proposal your strategy for management of IPRs and their protection

For example:

– Check existing patents – state whether they can be a barrier to exploitation and how you intend to overcome it > Freedom to Operate

– Clearly outline the expected IPRs from your project (capable of commercial/industrial exploitation)

– Outline how you will handle / share background information and expected project results and how do you envisage to protect your results


Impact

• Provide the baseline, targets and metrics to measure the impact.

Gender

• Do not confuse "gender dimension" (i.e. integrating sex and gender analysis into the content of the action) with "gender balance" of the research teams (especially in case of the biophotonic themes and CSA in ICT-05)

Other: Monitor the call/topic website for updates and Q&As/FAQs

Best,

Simona
