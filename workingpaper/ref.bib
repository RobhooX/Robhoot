abstract = {In this paper we survey the literature on the Black-Litterman model. This survey is provided both as a chronology and a taxonomy as there are many claims on the model in the literature. We provide a complete description of the canonical model including full derivations from the underlying principles using both Theil's Mixed Estimation model and Bayes Theory. The various parameters of the model are considered, along with information on their computation or calibration. Further consideration is given to several of the key papers, with worked examples illustrating the concepts.},

@article{Bailey2013,
abstract = {We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote “backtest overfitting”. The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit. Because most financial analysts and academics rarely report the number of configurations tried for a given backtest, investors cannot evaluate the degree of overfitting in most investment proposals. The implication is that investors can be easily misled into allocating capital to strategies that appear to be mathematically sound and empirically supported by an outstanding backtest. Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance. This may be one of several reasons why so many quantitative funds appear to fail.},
