Pragmatic vs Robhoot 


Architecture _________________________________________________________________________

A. Pragmatic: Modularity :: R, julia, python... :: 
   One manual reproducible analysis             
   
   Robhoot: Integration: Airflow, or similar :: 
   Many automated reproducible analysis (from database generation to reporting)


B. Pragmatic: Lab scale analysis :: 
   One reproducible analysis
   
   Robhoot: Causal Learning in Federated Networks :: 
   Population of reproducible analysis across the network each learning from each other
_______________________________________________________________________________________


Data Integration________________________________________________________________

    Pragmatic: Datasets from a few servers :: 
    csv or direct https download :: sql (clickhouse or other)

    Robhoot: Many datasets from many servers :: 
    Data mining software, fluentd or similar, data log first, database later :: 
    sql (clickhouse or other)
________________________________________________________________________________


Bayesian Space Models___________________________________________________

   Pragmatic: Few hypothesis 
   (i.e., Priors and posteriors with SIR models)

   Robhoot: Open-ended model exploration 
   (i.e., thousands of scenarios with generalized SIR models)
_________________________________________________________________________


Visualization & Reporting_______________________________________________

  A. Pragmatic: Plots of main results 
     (i.e., corona example 2D phase space sampling vs contact process)
   
     Robhoot: Automated animations of whole process, 
     from sampling thousands models to posterior distributions

  B. Pragmatic: Handmade writing here and there
     Robhoot: Automated reporting and reference built using 
     natural processing language
