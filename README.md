# Robhoot Vision

High-resolution data come from many sources. Yet, inferring insightful patterns and drivers remains challenging in many disciplines. Robhoot aims to develop approaches to integrate data, statistical Learning, AI algorithms and process-based models to take better informed decisions in research, management and investment landscapes.

We process and analyze the data in different layers. Within each layer there are different methods that can complete the task. Ideally, one should be able to choose any method from each layer.

## Data processing layers

### 1. Data Collection (DC)

We collect and clean data received from different sources. The collected data can be available in CSV, database, or "real time" (e.g. [Nakamoto Terminal](https://www.nterminal.com), [BigQuery]( https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)). We aim to have a package in Julia language and let the user automatically get the data in their desired format.

## 2. Complexity Reduction (CR)

To increase performance, we would reduce data complexity with methods such PCA.

## 3. Pattern Inference (PI)

Some of the available methods are variance-covariance matrices, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## 4. Model Validation (MV)

Model validation can be Bayesian Inference, Approximate Bayesian Inference, and common goodness of fit methods.
