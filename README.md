# Robhoot
The access to high-resolution data and models to track trends in time series remains difficult in many disciplines. 
In the investment industry, AI automated algorithms coexist today with classical portfolio models. Yet, tools to compare predictions
between data and models are scarce. Robhoot aims to develop an open platform to integrate data, AI algorithms and classic portfolio models to track the investment strategies that best fit to the data.
