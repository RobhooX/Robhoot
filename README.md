High-resolution data come from many sources. Yet, inferring insightful patterns and drivers integrating many datasets remains challenging in many disciplines. Robhoot aims to develop approaches to integrate data, statistical Learning, AI algorithms and process-based models to take better informed decisions in research, management and investment landscapes.

Robhoot will implement algorithms to find robust and efficient paths by integrating the following five layers:

## 1. Data Collection (DC)

Algorithms will collect, clean and integrate data received from many sources. The collected data will be available in CSV, mysql, or "real time data" (e.g. [Nakamoto Terminal](https://www.nterminal.com), [BigQuery]( https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)). We aim to have a package in Julia to let the user automatically get the integrated data in their desired format. The package for data collection and integration will contain different algorithms to do the job. Algorithms will be used depending on a set of traits the researcher want from the data.

## 2. Complexity Reduction (CR)

To increase performance, we will reduce data dimensionality using a variety of model complexity reduction methods. Robhoot will combine classical PCA and correlation methods and information theory metrics in multilayer networks.

## 3. Pattern Process Inference (PPI)

Many patterns can be extracted from data. We aim to combine classic variance-covariance matrix methods with AI, machine learning, and process-based stochastic and deterministic modeling to understand the processes underlying the patterns.

## 4. Model Validation (MV)

We will use different model selection criteria accounting for uncertainty in the parameter estimations using information theory methods, Bayesian Inference and Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. 

## 5. Visualization (VI)

We will use plotting and visualization tools (e.g., [Plotly](https://plot.ly/), [JoVE](https://www.jove.com/visualize)) for the empirical patterns and the models that best predict the empirical patterns. We will summarize the patterns and processes in compact and clean animation tools to help to improve the multilayer protocol and in making decisions in research, management and investment landscapes.
