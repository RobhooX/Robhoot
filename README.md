### Hey Guys -- I'm ROBHOOT and I'm training to be a causal learning federated network. I am aiming to help humanity in solving social, ecological, technological and sustainability challenges.   

Global sustainability is a major goal of humanity. Many studies have shown global sustainability could be achieved by strengthening feedbacks between social, ecological and governance systems. Sustainability goals, however, strongly depend on filling evidence- and research-based knowledge gaps. Yet, the science, technological and digital ecosystem lack expertise in developing technologies to narrow down the knowledge gaps in a reproducible and open science ecosystem. In this regard, I  aim to generate reproducible science fully accounting for the research cycle along a federated network. I will be trained to target the reduction of knowledge gaps by generating open-access reproducible global science reports. This way, NGOs and GOs can have access without depending of third parties to have more information when taking decisions about complex social, ecological and governance problems. I'm a hybrid-neutral-technology to lay out the foundation of an open-science ecosytem strengthening the robustness, decentralization and reproducibility of science. Guys, I'm not set out to deliver a finished research open network in the science ecosystem yet, but I'm looking forward to provide a science-enabled technology in establishing a prototype proof-of-principle to connect automated, decentralized and neutral-knowledge generation with knowledge-inspired societies.

I'm being developed in four stages. The most advanced version, Robhoot v.4.0 will provide real-time open-access global science reporting in a decentralized neutral-knowledge network to gain informed decisions when solving complex social, governance, environmental and technological problems. Automating fully the research cycle in a open decentralized research network ultimately aims to contrast human-expertise generated science with machine-generated science to enrich human-knowledge in a neutral-knowledge-inspired society. The following readme is a brief (draft) description of each of the Robhoot versions. Please take a look at the open issues for contributing to Robhoot development:

### ROBHOOT v.1.0: AUTOMATED RESEARCH CYCLE

#### UNIVERSAL ETLs

The ETLs algorithms will generate a network connecting the ETLs features associated to each database features. The ETLs algorithms will be developed in open-source language to extract, transform , load and ultimately, integrate data with different properties (i.e., formats, historical-real time, storage, dimensions, size, sampling bias and spatiotemporal resolution). 

#### BAYESIAN SPACE MODELS

Bayesian networks will explore generalized open-ended language of models combining Bayesian and optimization methods. The Bayesian space models module will search, evaluate models trading-off complexity, fit to data and quantify resource usage to extract properties like inference robustness and validation.
 
#### ANIMATION SPACE

The open-source codes for visualization schemes will generate animations of the processes making reproducible the research cycle together with the exploration of open-ended models to make the whole search transparent, highly visual and reproducible.

#### REPORTING

Natural language processing algorithms will be used to automatically explain the structure of the Bayesian space modeling module. It will also report a summary of the visualization patterns and the procedures followed by the Universal ETLs.


#### ROBHOOT v.1.0 TESTNET

ROBHOOT v.1.0 TESTNET will explore ``Biodiversity and Global Change Research'' as a case study to explore the robustness of the automated research cycle to generate open global science reports.

#### The following are at least five properties of ROBHOOT v.1.0:

* Science of science: Inferring paths when responding to questions by providing distributions of solutions that show high robutness in fitting to the empirical patterns.
* Identifying the strength of bias and uncertainty in inference.
* Exploring predictions-explanatory gradients to gain sinergy between predictive and explanatory power.
* Identifying gaps in patterns not explored consequence of lack of integration within and between disciplines (i.e., research knowledge gap), and
* Facilitating the 4R in open science: reusability, repeatability, replicability, and reproducibility.


ROBHOOT v.1.0 TESTNET will develop a prototype of a DECENTRALIZED AUTOMATED RESEARCH NETWORK (DARENET) to explore the properties of an open and decentralized automated research network

#### DARENET

* FUNCTIONAL SCRIPT WORKFLOW INTEGRATING LANGUAGES (PYTHON, JULIA, JAVA, NATURAL LAUNGUAGE PROCESSING, ...)

Prototyping a script workflow to automate the layers of the research cycle, from data adquisition and integration to validation and visualization in a decentralized database (i.e., BIGCHAINDB)

### ROBHOOT v.2.0: KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS

ROBHOOT v.2.0 will develop, implement and test algorithms to track paths of the research cycle developed in ROBHOOT v.1.0. ROBHOOT v.2.0 will work with the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) concept exploring a suite of open-source lineage client-tracker algorithms (i.e., Renku and others).

### ROBHOOT v.3.0: DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS

ROBHOOT v.3.0 will deploy automated deep learning algorithms to sample paths of the research cycle to produce populations of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). ROBHOOT v.3.0 will quantify the robustness of the population of KGs combining Bayesian networks and optimization algorithms.

### ROBHOOT v.4.0: DISTRIBUTED LEDGER NETWORK

ROBHOOT v.4.0 will deploy a permissioned-permissionless distributed ledger technology to guarantee decentralization, open-access, a neutral-knowledge-based network and prior confidenciality/posterior reproducibility of the KGs populations. ROBHOOT v.4.0 will explore a suite of consensus algorithms and smart contracts among trusted-untrusted peer-to-peer interactions scenarios to infer macroscopic metrics of the open research network like security, scalability and decentralization properties. Finally, ROBHOOT v.4.0 will generate a mainnet Open Research Network to cryptographically link each population of KGs to previous KGs-ledger to create an historical KGs-ledger chain that goes back to the genesis ledger in the Open Research Network. The ROBHOOT mainnet network aims to functionally work in the digital ecosystem connecting multiple database with real-time open-access citizen data science to knowledge-inspired societies.
